NOTE: item 1 can be done via v1 api and is a work in progress for v2 api
NOTE: items 2-4 can be done via waterbutler endpoints
NOTE: item 5 exists already, however, the value is None most of the time (even once the file has been
        edited multiple times on the OSF) The backup is to use waterbutler's revisions endpoint, which
        works like a charm
NOTE: https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io/issues/3309 shows what the current work in progress is on the api

1) determining which nodes are top-level nodes

2) creating files/folders on the OSF
3) renaming files/folder on OSF
4) updating files on OSF

5) timestamp for file/folder
