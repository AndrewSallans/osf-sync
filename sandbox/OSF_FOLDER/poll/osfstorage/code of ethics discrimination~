One of the imperatives described in the ACM Code of ethics is "[b]e fair and take action not to discriminate" (1.4, ACM Code of Ethics). This imperative is not plausible at times by moral and honest people and thus people should choose not to follow this imperative at such times. One such case is when creating a website that targets a specific group of people. According to the ACM Code of Ethics, the developer should try his/her best to make the website accessible to all, but this would lead to extra and potentially unneccessary work for the developer. Even worse, this would end up costing the employers of the developer extra unneccessary money. A specific example of when this issue can arise is when a developer is building a website for a American Flag salesmen. The developer would not be following the ACM Code of Ethics by making the website only usable for English-speaking users and thus discriminating against different nationalities, but this discrimination is actually preferable. The liklihood of this website being used by non-Americans is slim and thus it is wasteful for the developer to spend extra resources of the employer making the website usable for non-Americans.
